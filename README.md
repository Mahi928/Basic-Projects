## 🔍 What’s Inside?

### ✈️ Flight Planner
**Plan flights, optimize connections, and navigate airports like a pro!**  
This project models a simplified airline route planner that calculates optimal paths between cities, factoring in flight availability and timings. A great showcase of graphs, pathfinding, and scheduling logic.

➡️ *Explore how Dijkstra's algorithm meets the real world!*

---

### 🪐 Galactic Cargo Management System
**Forget Earth — logistics just went interstellar!**  
Manage cargo transfers between planets, balance storage capacities, and handle trade requests. This sci-fi-inspired system blends queues, heaps, and intelligent scheduling in a galaxy far, far away.

➡️ *Perfect for learning object-oriented design and resource allocation strategies.*

---

### 📚 Library Digitalization
**From dusty shelves to dynamic databases!**  
Simulate a digital library system where books can be searched, borrowed, returned, and managed with efficiency. This project incorporates hash maps (without using Python's built-in dict), file I/O, and custom search logic.

➡️ *Experience how data structures can modernize the world of books.*

---

### 🏴‍☠️ Treasure Quest: The Straw Hat Crew
**Pirates, scheduling, and heaps of gold (literally)!**  
Join the Straw Hat pirates in organizing treasure piles efficiently using custom-built heaps and intelligent task scheduling. It’s a fun and challenging dive into priority queues, greedy algorithms, and load balancing.

➡️ *A must-see if you love One Piece or want to master heaps and scheduling policies.*
